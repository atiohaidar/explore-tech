# Original BertSum Implementation - Using Pretrained Models

This implementation provides **BertSum-style text summarization** using **pretrained models** without requiring training.

## 🎯 What's Different from Original BertSum?

| Aspect | Original BertSum (Research) | This Implementation |
|--------|----------------------------|-------------------|
| **Training Required** | ✅ Yes (50k+ steps) | ❌ No training needed |
| **Model Type** | BERT + trained classifier | BERT + pretrained summarizers |
| **Approach** | Supervised extractive | Multiple approaches |
| **Data Needed** | CNN/DM dataset | None required |
| **Setup Time** | Days | Minutes |

## 🚀 Available Methods

### 1. **Extractive Summarization** (BERT + Clustering)
```python
# Like simplified BertSum - no training required
- Uses BERT embeddings for sentence representation
- K-means clustering to find diverse sentences
- Selects most representative sentences per cluster
```

### 2. **Abstractive Summarization** (T5/BART)
```python
# Uses pretrained transformer models
- T5 (Text-To-Text Transfer Transformer)
- BART (Bidirectional Auto-Regressive Transformer)
- Generates new summary text (not extract from original)
```

### 3. **Hybrid Approach** (Extractive + Abstractive)
```python
# Best of both worlds
- First: BERT clustering to select key sentences
- Then: T5 to refine and rephrase the summary
```

## 🛠️ Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install torch transformers flask flask-cors scikit-learn

# Run the app
./run_original_bertsum.sh

# Open browser: http://localhost:5001
```

## 📊 Performance Comparison

| Method | Accuracy | Speed | Use Case |
|--------|----------|-------|----------|
| Extractive | Good | ⚡ Fast | Factual summaries |
| Abstractive | Better | 🐌 Slower | Natural summaries |
| Hybrid | Best | Medium | Balanced approach |

## 🎨 Web Interface Features

- **Method Selection**: Choose between Extractive, Abstractive, or Hybrid
- **Dynamic Controls**: Sentence count control for extractive methods
- **Real-time Processing**: See results instantly
- **Statistics**: Word count, compression ratio

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Models Used:
- **BERT-base-uncased**: For sentence embeddings (extractive)
- **T5-small**: For abstractive summarization
- **BART-large-cnn**: Alternative abstractive model

### Key Functions:
```python
def extractive_summarize(text, num_sentences):
    # BERT embeddings + K-means clustering

def abstractive_summarize(text, model_type):
    # Pretrained T5/BART generation

def hybrid_summarize(text, num_sentences):
    # Extractive selection + Abstractive refinement
```

## 💡 When to Use Each Method

### Extractive:
- ✅ When you want factual, verbatim sentences
- ✅ For legal/technical documents
- ✅ When speed is important
- ✅ When you need to preserve original wording

### Abstractive:
- ✅ When you want natural, flowing summaries
- ✅ For general audience consumption
- ✅ When paraphrasing is acceptable
- ✅ For creative content

### Hybrid:
- ✅ When you want the best of both worlds
- ✅ For important documents needing both accuracy and readability
- ✅ When you have time for slightly slower processing

## 🎯 Example Usage

```python
from original_bertsum_app import extractive_summarize, abstractive_summarize

text = "Your long article text here..."

# Extractive (fast, factual)
summary1 = extractive_summarize(text, num_sentences=3)

# Abstractive (slower, natural)
summary2 = abstractive_summarize(text, model_type='t5')

# Hybrid (best quality)
summary3 = hybrid_summarize(text, num_sentences=2)
```

## 🚀 Running the Application

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start the server
./run_original_bertsum.sh

# Terminal 2: Check health
curl http://localhost:5001/health

# Terminal 3: Test API
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/summarize \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text": "Your text here", "method": "extractive", "num_sentences": 2}'
```

## 📈 Advantages Over Original BertSum

1. **No Training Required**: Works immediately
2. **Multiple Methods**: Extractive, abstractive, hybrid
3. **Better Performance**: Uses larger, better-trained models
4. **Flexible**: Can switch between approaches
5. **Modern Models**: T5, BART are state-of-the-art

## 🎉 Summary

This implementation gives you **BertSum-style summarization** without the complexity of training, using **pretrained models** that are ready to use. It's perfect for:

- **Quick prototyping**
- **Production applications**
- **Educational purposes**
- **Research comparisons**

The original BertSum research showed great results, and this implementation captures the same spirit while being much more practical to use!
