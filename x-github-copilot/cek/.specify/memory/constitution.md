# RustHTML Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Rust-Core
All core functionality must be implemented in Rust to leverage its performance, memory safety, and concurrency features. Rust code must follow best practices for error handling and resource management.

### II. HTML-Web-Integration
Provide seamless integration with HTML for web-based user interfaces and content generation. Ensure compatibility with modern web standards and accessibility guidelines.

### III. WebAssembly-Compilation
Utilize WebAssembly to compile Rust code for execution in web browsers, enabling client-side functionality while maintaining Rust's safety guarantees.

### IV. Test-Driven-Development
Follow TDD principles: write tests first, ensure they fail, then implement functionality to pass tests. Maintain high test coverage for all Rust code.

### V. Simplicity-and-Maintainability
Keep the codebase simple, avoid unnecessary complexity, and prioritize maintainability. Use clear naming conventions and modular design.

## Technology Stack
Primary language: Rust for core logic and performance-critical components. Web technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript for user interfaces. Compilation target: WebAssembly for web deployment. Build tool: Cargo for Rust dependencies and compilation.

## Development Workflow
Use Cargo for dependency management, building, and testing. Follow Rust's testing conventions with unit and integration tests. Use standard web development tools for HTML/CSS/JS components. Code reviews required for all changes. Automated testing gates for CI/CD.

## Governance
Constitution supersedes all other practices. Amendments require consensus from core contributors and must include justification and migration plan. Version follows semantic versioning: MAJOR for breaking changes, MINOR for new features, PATCH for fixes. Compliance reviews mandatory for all PRs.
